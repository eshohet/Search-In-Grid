# Search Challenge

Given a 10 x 10 grid of alphabetic characters, write an algorithm for finding a specific word within the grid.  Letters in the word may be joined horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally - but the same letter may not be used more than once in the word (ie: no reversal).  The algorithm should return the grid position ("x,y" coordinates) of each letter in the word as a set (array).
